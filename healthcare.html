            <h4>Read This First — Healthcare Reality Check</h4>
            <p>Saint Lucia's healthcare is adequate for routine and general medical needs. It is <strong>not adequate as a sole resource for retirees with serious, complex, or rapidly evolving medical conditions</strong>. International health insurance (US$300–600/month for retirees aged 60–75) and medevac insurance (US$300–500/year) are non-negotiable. If budget constraints mean you cannot afford both, Saint Lucia may not be the right retirement destination for you.</p>

            <button class="accordion-header">Tapion Hospital — Private (Castries) — Expat Primary Choice<span class="accordion-icon">+</span></button>
            <div class="accordion-body">
              <p>Tapion Hospital is Saint Lucia's leading private hospital and is consistently the first choice for resident expatriates, retirees, and anyone with private health insurance. Located on the waterfront in the Tapion area of Castries, it offers a modern, clean facility with 24-hour emergency services, diagnostic imaging (X-ray, ultrasound, CT scanning), laboratory services, and a range of specialist consultants who rotate through the facility.</p>
              <p><strong>Services available at Tapion:</strong> Emergency medicine, general surgery, orthopaedics (routine), gynaecology, ophthalmology, physiotherapy, diabetic care, cardiology (general, not interventional), gastroenterology, urology, and general internal medicine.</p>
              <p><strong>Standards:</strong> Clean, modern, English-speaking staff throughout. Doctor quality is generally good — many trained in the UK, USA, or Canada. Waiting times far shorter than public facilities. Most international health insurance plans are accepted with direct billing arrangements.</p>
              <p><strong>Limitations:</strong> No advanced cardiac interventional suite (catheterisation lab for stenting or angioplasty). No full oncology programme. ICU capacity is limited. Complex neurosurgery and major trauma surgery typically requires evacuation.</p>
              <p><strong>Cost without insurance:</strong> GP consultation EC$150–250 (US$55–93). Specialist consultation EC$300–500 (US$111–185). Emergency room visit EC$300–800 (US$111–296) plus investigations.</p>

            <button class="accordion-header">Victoria Hospital — Public (Castries) — Main Government Hospital<span class="accordion-icon">+</span></button>
            <div class="accordion-body">
              <p>Victoria Hospital is Saint Lucia's main government hospital, located in central Castries. It provides free or heavily subsidised healthcare to Saint Lucian citizens and legal residents. Services include emergency medicine, general surgery, obstetrics, paediatrics, general medicine, and psychiatry.</p>
              <p><strong>For retirees:</strong> Victoria Hospital handles the bulk of the island's healthcare workload and can be very busy. Infrastructure has improved in recent years but remains stretched. Waiting times can be very long (4–12+ hours in emergency). Equipment and facilities are variable — some areas are well-maintained, others less so. English is spoken throughout.</p>
              <p><strong>Practical use for retirees:</strong> Some retirees use Victoria Hospital for straightforward matters where cost is a concern (prescription collection, blood tests). For anything time-sensitive or requiring quality diagnostics, Tapion is strongly preferred by expatriate retirees.</p>

            <button class="accordion-header">St. Jude Hospital — Public (Vieux Fort, South) — Rebuilt 2025<span class="accordion-icon">+</span></button>
            <div class="accordion-body">
              <p>St. Jude Hospital in Vieux Fort was completely rebuilt at a cost of US$75 million and fully reopened in November 2025. This is a major milestone for healthcare in the south of the island. The new facility significantly expands capacity for emergency medicine, surgery, and diagnostics in southern Saint Lucia — a region that previously had very limited acute care.</p>
              <p><strong>For retirees in the south:</strong> Retirees living in Vieux Fort, Choiseul, Laborie, or near Hewanorra airport now have access to a modern public hospital without the 1.5-hour drive to Castries. The new St. Jude has better infrastructure than the old building, and while it is a public facility (expect busy, variable wait times), it represents a genuine improvement for those living in the southern districts.</p>
              <p>Note: As a new facility in 2025–2026, its operational capacity and staffing levels are still being developed. Initial reports are positive.</p>

            <div class="accordion-body">
              <p>Saint Lucia operates a network of district polyclinics and health centres spread across all 11 constituencies. These provide primary care, immunisations, maternal health, chronic disease management (diabetes, hypertension), and prescription dispensing. For retirees managing stable, well-controlled chronic conditions, these are accessible and free for registered patients.</p>
              <p>Locations include: Gros Islet, Rodney Bay, Castries, Dennery, Micoud, Soufrière, Vieux Fort, Laborie, and others. Opening hours are typically Monday–Friday during office hours.</p>

        <h2 id="emergency">Emergency Services</h2>
        <p><strong>Emergency number:</strong> 911 (police, fire, ambulance).</p>
        <p>Ambulance services are available but response times vary significantly by location. In Castries and the Rodney Bay corridor, response times are typically 10–20 minutes. In rural or remote areas (Soufrière, Dennery, Canaries), response times can be 30–60+ minutes. Many serious emergencies in Saint Lucia reach hospital via private vehicle rather than ambulance.</p>
        <p>For cardiac arrests and strokes, the time-to-treatment window is critical. Retirees with significant cardiac risk should be realistic about the response time limitations and ensure they live within reasonable proximity to Tapion Hospital or the new St. Jude Hospital.</p>

            <h4>If You Have Significant Cardiac History</h4>
            <p>If you have a history of heart attack, bypass surgery, complex arrhythmia, or significant heart failure, consult your cardiologist specifically about whether living in Saint Lucia — with its limitations in interventional cardiology and response times — is appropriate for your risk profile. This is a deeply personal medical decision that should not be made without qualified medical advice.</p>

                <li><strong>Medical evacuation:</strong> Should cover evacuation to Barbados, Trinidad, Miami, or home country. Costs US$20,000–80,000+ without insurance.</li>
                <li><strong>Repatriation of remains:</strong> Morbid but essential — costs US$10,000–25,000 without cover.</li>
                <li><strong>Outpatient cover:</strong> GP visits, specialist consultations, diagnostics. High-deductible plans save premium but increase out-of-pocket costs — model your expected usage.</li>
                <li><strong>Prescription drugs:</strong> Ensure your regular medications are covered. Specialty drugs may require prior authorisation.</li>
                <li><strong>Mental health:</strong> Parity of cover with physical health is preferable.</li>
                <li><strong>Dental:</strong> Often a separate module — worth adding if you want comprehensive dental cover (basic dental in Saint Lucia is affordable; major work may require travel).</li>
                <li><strong>US treatment option:</strong> If you are a US citizen or want the option to return to the US for treatment, ensure the policy explicitly covers US treatment. Many international plans exclude the US unless specifically added (at significantly higher cost).</li>

            <div class="accordion-body">
              <p>Declare all pre-existing conditions honestly when applying for health insurance. Failing to declare a condition can invalidate your entire policy if a claim arises — a catastrophic financial outcome.</p>
              <p>Insurers' approaches to pre-existing conditions vary:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Moratorium underwriting:</strong> All pre-existing conditions from the past 2–5 years are excluded initially; after 2 years of no symptoms or treatment, conditions may be covered. Popular choice for retirees with minor historical conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Full medical underwriting:</strong> You declare everything upfront. Named conditions are permanently excluded or rated (higher premium). Provides clarity but can leave significant gaps for retirees with complex histories.</li>
                <li><strong>Conditional inclusion:</strong> Some conditions are covered with specific exclusions, co-pays, or sub-limits. Read carefully.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>For retirees with significant cardiac, oncological, neurological, or major chronic conditions, work with an independent international health insurance broker (not just a single insurer) to find the best coverage. Some conditions that would be exclusions at one insurer are covered at another.</p>

        <h2 id="medevac">Medical Evacuation (Medevac)</h2>
        <p>Medical evacuation is the process of transporting a critically ill or injured patient by air ambulance to a facility capable of providing the required level of care. For Saint Lucia, the most common medevac destinations are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Barbados</strong> (30 minutes by air) — Queen Elizabeth Hospital; good for most Caribbean-level emergencies</li>
          <li><strong>Martinique</strong> (25 minutes by air) — French overseas department with EU-standard hospitals; some language barrier</li>
          <li><strong>Trinidad</strong> (1.5 hours) — Port of Spain General; reasonable specialist care</li>
          <li><strong>Miami, USA</strong> (3.5 hours) — World-class care; very expensive without insurance; complex logistics for non-US-citizens</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Cost without insurance:</strong> Air ambulance charter from Saint Lucia to Barbados: US$15,000–25,000. To Miami: US$40,000–80,000+.</p>

        <p><strong>Standalone medevac insurance</strong> options (if your health insurance evacuation cover is limited):</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>MedjetAssist</strong> — US$310–415/year; transport to hospital of choice including home country</li>
          <li><strong>Battleface / IMG</strong> — from US$300/year; strong Caribbean coverage</li>
          <li><strong>Global Rescue</strong> — US$329–499/year; field rescue plus medical transport</li>
        </ul>

            <h4>Medevac Insurance is Separate from Health Insurance</h4>
            <p>Many international health insurance policies include evacuation cover — but check the limits carefully. Some cap it at US$50,000, others at US$250,000+. An actual air ambulance flight with medical crew can exhaust a low cap quickly. If your health policy's evacuation benefit is limited, a standalone medevac subscription (US$300–500/year) is excellent value insurance against a catastrophic out-of-pocket expense.</p>

        <h2 id="prescriptions">Prescriptions and Medications</h2>
        <p>Most common prescription medications are available in Saint Lucia through pharmacies in Castries, Rodney Bay, and Vieux Fort. Mainstream medications for hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, thyroid conditions, and common infections are reliably stocked.</p>

        <p><strong>What may not be available locally:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Specialty biologics and monoclonal antibodies (oncology, autoimmune conditions)</li>
          <li>Some newer diabetes medications (GLP-1 agonists like Ozempic — variable availability)</li>
          <li>Specialty psychiatric medications</li>
          <li>Some cardiovascular drugs not commonly used in the Caribbean formulary</li>
          <li>Some pain management medications (strict controlled substance regulations)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Bringing medications from home:</strong> Retirees often bring a 3–6 month supply of specialty drugs when they travel. Declare medications at customs with a physician's letter. Quantity limits apply for controlled substances — check Saint Lucia's customs regulations before travelling with significant quantities.</p>
        <p><strong>Online pharmacies and shipping:</strong> International online pharmacies can ship medications to Saint Lucia. Duty may apply. Allow 2–3 weeks for delivery. For critical ongoing medications, always maintain a buffer stock.</p>
        <p><strong>Generic vs branded:</strong> Generic versions of most common medications are available and generally well-priced.</p>

        <h2 id="dental">Dental and Vision Care</h2>
        <p><strong>Dental:</strong> Saint Lucia has a reasonable number of dentists, particularly in Castries and Rodney Bay. Routine dental care — check-ups, fillings, extractions, crowns — is available and significantly more affordable than in the US or UK. A dental check-up costs approximately EC$80–150 (US$30–56). A filling EC$150–350 (US$56–130). Crown work EC$700–1,200 (US$260–444). Cosmetic dentistry, implants, and complex oral surgery may be of variable quality — for major work, many retirees travel to Barbados or Martinique where specialist dental practices cater to expat clientele.</p>
        <p><strong>Vision:</strong> Optometrists are available in Castries. Eye tests, glasses, and contact lenses can all be obtained locally. The selection of frames and lens options is more limited than in major cities, but functional glasses and contacts are routinely available. Complex eye surgery (LASIK, cataract surgery, retinal procedures) is available at Tapion but complex cases may prefer referral to larger regional facilities.</p>

        <h2 id="mental-health">Mental Health</h2>
        <p>Mental health services in Saint Lucia are limited in scope and capacity. The Saint Lucia Mental Wellness Centre provides inpatient psychiatric services. General practitioners can prescribe common psychiatric medications (antidepressants, anxiolytics). However, specialist psychiatric and psychological support is quite limited, and the cultural stigma around mental health conditions can make open discussion challenging.</p>
        <p>For retirees managing anxiety, depression, adjustment disorders (very common in first years abroad), or other mental health conditions, telehealth has become a valuable resource. US-based therapists and psychiatrists can provide video consultations, and platforms like BetterHelp, Talkspace, and direct-practice telehealth are widely used by expats globally. Ensure your health insurance covers telehealth consultations.</p>

        <h2 id="preexisting">Planning with Pre-existing Conditions</h2>
        <p>If you are managing any of the following conditions, have a specific conversation with your specialist before committing to retirement in Saint Lucia:</p>

              <h4>Heart Disease</h4>
              <p>If you are at high risk of requiring interventional cardiology (stenting, angioplasty, bypass), Saint Lucia's lack of a catheterisation laboratory is a genuine safety consideration. Discuss with your cardiologist.</p>

              <h4>Cancer</h4>
              <p>Active cancer treatment or high recurrence risk requiring regular oncology monitoring and potential complex treatment makes Saint Lucia a challenging retirement base. Stable, well-controlled cancer in remission may be manageable with annual visits to home-country specialists.</p>
