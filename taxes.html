            <h4>This Is Educational Information — Not Tax Advice</h4>
            <p>Tax law is complex, jurisdiction-specific, and changes regularly. This guide gives you a practical overview of the key issues, but your personal tax situation requires advice from qualified professionals: a Saint Lucian tax advisor for local obligations and a tax professional in your home country who specialises in expats and foreign residents. Do not make major financial decisions based solely on this guide.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2 id="residency-rule">Tax Residency — The 183-Day Rule</h2>
        <p>In Saint Lucia, as in most countries, your tax obligations hinge on whether you are considered a <strong>tax resident</strong>. The primary test is physical presence: if you spend <strong>183 or more days per calendar year</strong> in Saint Lucia, you are generally treated as a tax resident and subject to Saint Lucia income tax on your worldwide income.</p>

        <div class="table-wrap">
          <table>
            <thead><tr><th>Situation</th><th>Saint Lucia Tax Treatment</th></tr></thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr><td class="td-label">Less than 183 days/year in SLC</td><td>Generally non-resident — typically taxed only on Saint Lucia-sourced income</td></tr>
              <tr><td class="td-label">183+ days/year in SLC</td><td>Tax resident — worldwide income is potentially subject to Saint Lucia income tax</td></tr>
              <tr><td class="td-label">Permanent resident or citizen</td><td>Tax resident — worldwide income potentially taxable in Saint Lucia</td></tr>
              <tr><td class="td-label">Property owner, non-resident</td><td>Any rental income derived from Saint Lucia property is taxable locally</td></tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
        </div>

        <p>The 183-day rule interacts with your home country's residency rules. Many countries — including the UK — also have complex tests for determining when you cease to be tax-resident there. Leaving a country for tax purposes is not always as simple as being physically absent for 183+ days. Get specific advice before you make any moves that you believe will change your tax residency status.</p>

        <h2 id="income-tax">Saint Lucia Income Tax</h2>
        <p>Saint Lucia operates a progressive income tax system with rates applied on taxable income above the personal allowance. The Inland Revenue Department administers income tax. The tax year runs from <strong>April 1 to March 31</strong>.</p>

        <div class="table-wrap">
          <table>
            <thead><tr><th>Taxable Income Band (EC$)</th><th>Tax Rate</th><th>Approx. US$ equivalent</th></tr></thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr><td class="td-label">First EC$18,000 (personal allowance)</td><td>0% — tax free</td><td>US$0–6,667</td></tr>
              <tr><td class="td-label">EC$18,001 – EC$30,000</td><td>10%</td><td>US$6,667–11,111</td></tr>
              <tr><td class="td-label">EC$30,001 – EC$60,000</td><td>15%</td><td>US$11,111–22,222</td></tr>
              <tr><td class="td-label">EC$60,001 – EC$100,000</td><td>20%</td><td>US$22,222–37,037</td></tr>
              <tr><td class="td-label">EC$100,001 – EC$200,000</td><td>25%</td><td>US$37,037–74,074</td></tr>
              <tr><td class="td-label">Above EC$200,000</td><td>30%</td><td>Above US$74,074</td></tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
        </div>

        <p><strong>Practical examples for retirees:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>A retiree with US$2,000/month income (US$24,000/year = EC$64,800): taxable income above EC$18,000 allowance = EC$46,800. Effective Saint Lucia tax: approximately EC$3,300–5,400 (US$1,222–2,000) per year — a modest burden.</li>
          <li>A retiree with US$5,000/month income (US$60,000/year = EC$162,000): more tax applies. Getting individual advice is worthwhile at this income level.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Double tax agreements (where they exist) may reduce or eliminate double taxation where the same income is taxed in both Saint Lucia and your home country. See the <a href="#dta">Double Tax Agreements</a> section below.</p>

        <h2 id="pension">Pension Income</h2>
        <p>Pension income received by a tax resident of Saint Lucia is generally taxable as income in Saint Lucia. There is no specific exemption for foreign pension income — it is treated as regular income subject to the progressive rates above, minus the EC$18,000 (US$6,667) personal allowance.</p>

        <p>However, double tax agreements (DTAs) may change the picture significantly:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Where a DTA exists between Saint Lucia and your home country, it may specify that pension income is taxed only in the country of source (i.e., your home country) or only in the country of residence (Saint Lucia), or is split between them. The DTA takes precedence over domestic law.</li>
          <li>Government pensions (military, civil service, public sector) are typically taxed exclusively in the country that pays them, regardless of where the recipient lives — this is a standard provision in most DTAs.</li>
          <li>Private pensions and annuities may be treated differently. Always verify the specific DTA provisions for your pension type and your nationality.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="capital-gains">No Capital Gains Tax — A Real Advantage</h2>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Saint Lucia Levies No Capital Gains Tax</h3>
          <p>This is one of the most meaningful tax advantages for retirees managing investment portfolios. Gains on the sale of property, stocks, shares, funds, or other assets are <strong>not subject to capital gains tax in Saint Lucia</strong>. If you sell your Saint Lucia property at a profit, that profit is yours free of CGT locally. If you sell investments held in a brokerage account, Saint Lucia does not tax those gains.</p>
          <p>Important caveat: <strong>your home country may still apply its own CGT rules</strong> to gains on assets you hold, depending on your residency status there. US citizens are taxed on worldwide capital gains regardless of where they live. UK residents (for UK tax purposes) pay UK CGT on UK assets even after moving abroad in many cases.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="property-tax">Property Tax</h2>
        <p>Property tax in Saint Lucia is assessed annually by the Inland Revenue Department at the following rates:</p>

        <div class="table-wrap">
          <table>
            <thead><tr><th>Property Category</th><th>Annual Tax Rate</th><th>Example: US$400K property</th></tr></thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr><td class="td-label">Residential (owner-occupied)</td><td>0.25% of market value</td><td>US$1,000/year (EC$2,700)</td></tr>
              <tr><td class="td-label">Residential (non-owner-occupied / rental)</td><td>0.40% of market value</td><td>US$1,600/year (EC$4,320)</td></tr>
              <tr><td class="td-label">Commercial</td><td>0.40–0.75%</td><td>Varies</td></tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
        </div>

        <p>Property tax is one of the lowest-burden aspects of owning property in Saint Lucia. For a typical retiree home, it amounts to a fraction of what you might pay in property taxes in the US, UK, or most European countries.</p>

        <h2 id="withholding">Withholding Taxes on Investment Income</h2>

        <div class="accordion-group">
          <div class="accordion">
            <button class="accordion-header">Dividend Withholding Tax<span class="accordion-icon">+</span></button>
            <div class="accordion-body">
              <p>Dividends paid by Saint Lucian companies to non-residents are subject to a <strong>15% withholding tax</strong>. If you hold shares in a Saint Lucian company and receive dividends, 15% is withheld at source. A DTA with your home country may reduce or eliminate this rate. For most retirees receiving foreign dividends into a Saint Lucia-based account, the dividends are taxed by the source country's rules, not Saint Lucia's, unless the paying company is Saint Lucian.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="accordion">
            <button class="accordion-header">Interest Income<span class="accordion-icon">+</span></button>
            <div class="accordion-body">
              <p>Interest earned on deposits in Saint Lucian banks by non-residents is generally subject to a 15% withholding tax. For tax residents, interest income is included in your assessable income for income tax purposes. As a practical matter, most retirees keep the bulk of their investment assets in their home country or in international brokerage accounts — the Saint Lucia bank account is primarily used for everyday EC$ transactions rather than as an investment account.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="accordion">
            <button class="accordion-header">Rental Income from Saint Lucia Property<span class="accordion-icon">+</span></button>
            <div class="accordion-body">
              <p>If you rent out your Saint Lucia property (including short-term vacation rentals), that rental income is taxable in Saint Lucia regardless of whether you are a resident or not. Gross rental income (after allowable deductions for property expenses) is subject to income tax. If you list your property on Airbnb, VRBO, or similar platforms while you are outside Saint Lucia for the season, the rental income is still a Saint Lucian tax obligation. A 15% withholding tax may apply to rental income paid to non-residents. Consult a local tax advisor if you plan to rent your property.</p>

          <div class="tip-content">
            <h4>US Citizens Are Taxed on Worldwide Income — Always</h4>
            <p>The United States is one of only two countries in the world (the other is Eritrea) that taxes its citizens on worldwide income regardless of where they live. Moving to Saint Lucia does not end your US federal income tax obligation. You must continue to file US federal income tax returns every year as a US citizen living abroad. This is not optional and non-compliance carries serious penalties.</p>

            <div class="accordion-body">
              <p>US citizens and permanent residents with foreign bank accounts totalling more than US$10,000 at any point during the year must file an FBAR (FinCEN Form 114) with the US Treasury Department. This covers your Saint Lucian bank accounts, any other foreign accounts, and foreign financial account interests. The filing deadline is April 15 (with automatic extension to October 15). Penalties for non-filing are severe — up to US$10,000 per violation for non-wilful failure, and US$100,000 or 50% of account value for wilful violations.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion-header">FATCA — Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act<span class="accordion-icon">+</span></button>
            <div class="accordion-body">
              <p>FATCA requires foreign financial institutions — including banks in Saint Lucia — to report information about financial accounts held by US persons to the IRS. This means your Saint Lucian bank may already be reporting your account to the IRS. Additionally, US persons with specified foreign financial assets above US$50,000 (or higher thresholds for those living abroad) must file Form 8938 with their tax return. This is in addition to, not instead of, the FBAR.</p>

            <div class="accordion-body">
              <p>If you have earned income abroad (not pension or investment income — only wages or self-employment income), the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (Form 2555) allows you to exclude up to approximately US$126,500 (2024, adjusted for inflation annually) of foreign earned income from US federal tax. This does not apply to pension income, Social Security, dividends, or investment returns.</p>

              <p>US Social Security benefits are generally taxable in the US regardless of where you live. Saint Lucia and the US do not have a Social Security Totalization Agreement, so there is no bilateral coordination of Social Security obligations. Your Social Security benefit will continue to be paid abroad (including to Saint Lucia) with no restrictions — direct deposit to a US bank account is the simplest arrangement. Up to 85% of your Social Security income may be taxable at the federal level depending on your provisional income.</p>

            <div class="accordion-body">
              <p>Whether you remain a UK tax resident after moving to Saint Lucia depends on the UK's Statutory Residence Test (SRT), which is a complex set of rules involving days spent in the UK, work in the UK, and various ties to the UK (family, property, work). Simply spending fewer than 183 days in the UK does not automatically make you non-resident for UK tax purposes. Get specific advice from a UK tax advisor before assuming you have ceased to be UK tax resident.</p>

              <p>UK State Pension is payable abroad to UK nationals, including those living in Saint Lucia. However, Saint Lucia is not on the UK's list of countries where the State Pension is uprated (increased annually for inflation). This means your UK State Pension will be frozen at the level it was when you first claimed it — it will not increase each year as it would if you lived in the UK or in a country with a reciprocal uprating agreement. This can significantly erode the real value of your pension over a long retirement. Research this carefully before committing to Saint Lucia.</p>

              <p>Some retirees consider transferring their UK private pension to a Qualifying Recognised Overseas Pension Scheme (QROPS) — a pension structure recognised by HMRC for overseas pension transfers. This can sometimes provide advantages in terms of local currency access, investment flexibility, and potential IHT benefits. However, QROPS transfers attract a 25% overseas transfer charge unless you or the receiving scheme are based in the same country, and the rules are complex and frequently updated. Get specialist UK pension advice before considering a QROPS transfer.</p>

            <div class="accordion-body">
              <p>UK Inheritance Tax (IHT) applies to UK-domiciled individuals on their worldwide assets, regardless of where those assets are held. Moving to Saint Lucia does not automatically change your UK domicile — UK domicile is a legal concept distinct from residency that is difficult to change. If you remain UK-domiciled, your Saint Lucia property will potentially be within the scope of UK IHT at 40% above the nil-rate band (currently £325,000 plus any residence nil-rate band). Proper estate planning with a UK specialist is essential for UK nationals with significant assets.</p>

        <h2 id="canadian">Canadian Retirees</h2>
        <p>Canada does have a tax treaty with several Caribbean nations but tax arrangements for Saint Lucia-based Canadians require specific advice. Canada taxes its residents on worldwide income, and determining when you cease to be a Canadian resident for tax purposes involves an assessment of residential ties (home, spouse, dependants, economic ties) rather than simply a day-count rule. "Deemed disposition" rules may trigger Canadian capital gains tax on certain assets when you become a non-resident.</p>
        <p>Canadian Old Age Security (OAS) and Canada Pension Plan (CPP) payments continue abroad but may be subject to a 25% non-resident withholding tax (reduced to 15% under a tax treaty where applicable — verify Saint Lucia's treaty status with Canada).

        <p>A Double Tax Agreement (DTA) is a bilateral treaty between two countries that allocates taxing rights on different types of income and prevents the same income from being taxed twice. Saint Lucia has a relatively limited DTA network compared to larger economies.</p>

        <div class="table-wrap">
          <table>
            <thead><tr><th>Country</th><th>DTA Status with Saint Lucia</th><th>Notes for Retirees</th></tr></thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr><td class="td-label">CARICOM nations</td><td>Agreement exists</td><td>Regional treaty covering Caribbean Community member states</td></tr>
              <tr><td class="td-label">United Kingdom</td><td>Limited historical agreement</td><td>Check current status; UK-Saint Lucia DTA coverage has specific provisions — get advice</td></tr>
              <tr><td class="td-label">United States</td><td>No comprehensive DTA</td><td>No bilateral income tax treaty — US citizens fully taxed by both countries on applicable income</td></tr>
              <tr><td class="td-label">Canada</td><td>No comprehensive DTA</td><td>Verify current status; limited TIEA (Tax Information Exchange Agreement) exists</td></tr>
              <tr><td class="td-label">Most EU countries</td><td>No DTA</td><td>European retirees should get specific bilateral advice</td></tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
        </div>

        <p>The absence of a DTA with the US is notable — it means US-citizen retirees in Saint Lucia cannot rely on a treaty to prevent double taxation. Instead, they must use US mechanisms (Foreign Tax Credit, Form 1116) to claim credit for any Saint Lucia taxes paid against their US tax liability.</p>

        <h2 id="vat">VAT on Daily Life</h2>
        <p>Value Added Tax (VAT) is charged on most goods and services in Saint Lucia at the following rates:</p>

        <div class="table-wrap">
          <table>
            <thead><tr><th>Category</th><th>VAT Rate</th></tr></thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr><td class="td-label">Standard rate (most goods and services)</td><td>12.5%</td></tr>
              <tr><td class="td-label">Hotel accommodation and related services</td><td>10%</td></tr>
              <tr><td class="td-label">Basic food items (fresh produce, staples)</td><td>0% (zero-rated)</td></tr>
              <tr><td class="td-label">Medical services</td><td>0% (zero-rated)</td></tr>
              <tr><td class="td-label">Exports</td><td>0% (zero-rated)</td></tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
        </div>

        <p>VAT is included in the prices you pay at shops, restaurants, and service providers. You do not file a VAT return as a private individual — it is collected and remitted by businesses. For retirees, VAT is simply an embedded cost of daily life and is already reflected in the price comparisons throughout our cost-of-living guide.</p>

        <h2 id="estate">Estate Planning in Saint Lucia</h2>
        <p>If you own assets in Saint Lucia — property, bank accounts, vehicles — those assets need to be covered by an appropriate estate plan.</p>

        <div class="accordion-group">
          <div class="accordion">
            <button class="accordion-header">Create a Saint Lucian Will<span class="accordion-icon">+</span></button>
            <div class="accordion-body">
              <p>If you own property or other significant assets in Saint Lucia, you should have a Saint Lucian will prepared by a Saint Lucian attorney to govern those local assets. A will from your home country may not be straightforwardly enforceable in Saint Lucia for local assets, and the probate process for foreign wills can be lengthy and expensive.</p>
              <p>A Saint Lucian will is a separate document from your home country will — it deals specifically with your Saint Lucian assets. Your two wills should be carefully drafted to avoid conflict. Typical cost: EC$500–1,500 (US$185–556) for a simple will prepared by a Saint Lucian attorney.</p>

          <div class="accordion">
            <button class="accordion-header">No Inheritance Tax in Saint Lucia<span class="accordion-icon">+</span></button>
            <div class="accordion-body">
              <p>Saint Lucia does not levy estate duty, inheritance tax, or gift tax. Assets transferred on death or gifted during lifetime are not subject to any local inheritance or gift tax. This is a genuine advantage — the estate of a Saint Lucia resident passes to heirs without a local tax burden. Stamp duty may apply on the registration of a property transfer to heirs, but this is modest.</p>
              <p>Remember: your home country may still apply its own inheritance or estate taxes on your worldwide assets or on assets transferred to nationals of your home country, depending on your domicile status.</p>

          <div class="accordion">
            <button class="accordion-header">Power of Attorney<span class="accordion-icon">+</span></button>
            <div class="accordion-body">
              <p>Set up a Saint Lucian power of attorney (POA) with a trusted person — attorney, family member, or trusted friend — who can manage your Saint Lucian affairs if you are temporarily incapacitated or outside the island. This is especially important for property management, banking, and administrative matters. Similarly, ensure that appropriate POA arrangements are in place in your home country to manage affairs there.</p>

        <h2 id="advisors">Finding a Tax Advisor</h2>
        <p>Tax planning as an expat retiree requires two types of professional:</p>

        <div class="cards-2col">
          <div class="card">
            <h3 style="color:var(--teal);">Saint Lucian Tax Advisor</h3>
            <p>For your local income tax return (if required), property tax, and local compliance matters. The Inland Revenue Department (IRD) can provide basic guidance on local obligations. A Saint Lucian accounting firm (look for firms affiliated with international networks like KPMG, PwC, or BDO in Castries) can provide more comprehensive advice.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h3 style="color:var(--teal);">Home Country Expat Tax Specialist</h3>
            <p>For US, UK, Canadian, or other national obligations — an accountant or tax advisor who specifically specialises in expatriates and foreign residents. This is not a standard domestic tax return — you need someone who knows the FBAR rules, FATCA, the foreign tax credit, FEIE, the Statutory Residence Test, or whatever applies to your nationality. This expertise costs more but is essential.</p>

            <h4>Budget for Professional Tax Advice</h4>
            <p>Expect to pay US$500–2,000+ per year for good expatriate tax preparation and advice between your home country and Saint Lucia obligations. For complex situations (significant investment portfolios, multiple property ownership, CBI citizenship alongside home country citizenship), costs may be higher. This is a legitimate expense of retiring abroad and far less costly than the penalties for non-compliance.</p>
