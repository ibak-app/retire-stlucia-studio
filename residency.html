            <h4>Always Use a Licensed Immigration Lawyer</h4>
            <p>Immigration law changes. This guide provides general educational information as of 2026. For your specific situation — especially for permanent residence and CBI applications — always engage a licensed Saint Lucian attorney or a CBI-accredited agent. Mistakes in immigration applications can be costly and cause significant delays.</p>

        <h2 id="visitor">Visitor Entry</h2>
        <p>Most Western nationals (US, UK, Canada, EU, Australia) can enter Saint Lucia as visitors without a prior visa for stays up to 6 weeks (42 days) initially, with extensions possible at the Immigration Department. The standard tourist entry allows up to 6 months total with extensions, provided you have:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A return or onward ticket</li>
          <li>Valid passport (minimum 6 months validity beyond intended stay)</li>
          <li>Proof of accommodation</li>
          <li>Sufficient funds to support your stay (no fixed minimum, but be prepared to demonstrate)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Visitor status does not give you the right to work, operate a business, or access public services. For retirees planning a trial period before committing, visitor status for 3–6 months is a practical first step.</p>

        <h2 id="temporary">Temporary Residence Permit</h2>
        <p>Once you decide to make Saint Lucia your long-term base, you should apply for a Temporary Residence Permit (TRP). This is the standard entry point for non-CARICOM foreign nationals wishing to reside in Saint Lucia long-term without working in local employment.</p>

                <li>2 recent passport-size photographs</li>

                <li>Proof of financial sufficiency — bank statements showing sufficient funds to support yourself without working (typically US$1,500–2,500/month minimum demonstrated income)</li>
                <li>Proof of accommodation in Saint Lucia (lease agreement or property deed)</li>
                <li>Character references (typically 2 letters from reputable individuals)</li>
                <li>Processing fee: approximately EC$500–800 (US$185–296) for initial application</li>
                <li>Permit fee: EC$500–1,000/year (US$185–370)</li>

              <p class="text-sm text-muted mt-16">Processing time: typically 4–12 weeks. Apply well before your visitor status expires. Renewals are typically processed faster than initial applications.</p>

            <button class="accordion-header">Renewing Your TRP<span class="accordion-icon">+</span></button>
            <div class="accordion-body">
              <p>TRPs are typically granted for 1 year and must be renewed annually. Renewal requires similar documentation to the initial application (updated police certificate, financial statements, medical certificate) and is generally straightforward if you have maintained good standing.</p>
              <p><strong>Important:</strong> Start your renewal process at least 2–3 months before the permit expiry. Immigration offices can be slow and appointment availability limited. Being in Saint Lucia on an expired permit, even briefly, can create complications for future renewals and permanent residence applications.</p>
              <p>Some retirees who spend part of the year abroad (e.g., escaping hurricane season) find that maintaining a TRP requires demonstrating continued Saint Lucia ties — retaining a rental property or home even while temporarily absent helps.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2 id="permanent">Permanent Residence</h2>
        <p>Permanent Residence in Saint Lucia gives you indefinite right to reside without annual renewals, and eventually opens the path to naturalisation (citizenship).</p>

        <div class="accordion-group">
          <div class="accordion">
            <button class="accordion-header">Qualifying for Permanent Residence<span class="accordion-icon">+</span></button>
            <div class="accordion-body">
              <p>There is no fixed, publicly published minimum residency period for permanent residence. In practice, applicants typically need to have held a TRP and demonstrated genuine continuous residence for several years (commonly cited as 5+ years, though this is subject to discretion).</p>
              <p>The application is considered on merit by the Governor General on the advice of the Chief Immigration Officer and Cabinet. Factors considered include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Length of lawful residence in Saint Lucia</li>
                <li>Financial self-sufficiency (demonstrated income from pension, investments, etc.)</li>
                <li>Good character (clean criminal record throughout residence)</li>
                <li>Investment in the country (property ownership, business activity)</li>
                <li>Community integration</li>
                <li>Health status (not a public charge risk)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Permanent residence is granted as a Permanent Residence Certificate. It does not automatically confer citizenship and does not give the right to vote.</p>

            <button class="accordion-header">Naturalisation (Full Citizenship via Residence)<span class="accordion-icon">+</span></button>
            <div class="accordion-body">
              <p>After holding Permanent Residence, a foreign national may apply for Saint Lucian citizenship through naturalisation. This requires an additional period of permanent residence (the exact requirement is discretionary and set by Cabinet) with demonstrated good character and integration.</p>
              <p>Naturalised citizenship grants full Saint Lucian citizenship including a Saint Lucian passport (visa-free access to 140+ countries, including the UK and Schengen Area). Saint Lucia permits dual citizenship, so you do not need to renounce your home country's citizenship in most cases — check your home country's rules.</p>

        <h2>Citizenship by Investment (CBI)</h2>
        <p>Saint Lucia's CBI Programme, established by the Saint Lucia Citizenship by Investment Act (No. 14 of 2015) and administered by the Citizenship by Investment Unit (CIU), offers a fast-track route to full Saint Lucian citizenship for qualifying investors. This is entirely separate from the residence pathway and has no minimum stay requirement.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Why Retirees Consider CBI</h3>
          <p>The Saint Lucian passport provides <span class="gold">visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 140+ countries</span> including the entire UK, EU Schengen Zone, and many others. For retirees from countries with weaker passports, or those wanting a second citizenship for estate planning, travel flexibility, or future-proofing, CBI is a serious option. There is no requirement to actually live in Saint Lucia — you can obtain citizenship and keep the passport without ever residing there.</p>

              <p>Additional costs: government processing fees (US$2,000–4,000), due diligence fees (US$7,500–15,000 per adult), attorney fees, and stamp duty on the real estate transaction.</p>

        <h2 id="caricom">CARICOM Nationals</h2>
        <p>Citizens of CARICOM (Caribbean Community) member states — including Jamaica, Barbados, Trinidad &amp; Tobago, Guyana, Grenada, Dominica, Antigua, and others — have significantly easier rights in Saint Lucia under the CARICOM Freedom of Movement agreements.</p>
        <p>Skilled CARICOM nationals with the CARICOM Skills Certificate can live and work freely in Saint Lucia. For retirees from CARICOM countries, the path to long-term residence is substantially simpler and less expensive than for nationals from outside the Caribbean Community.</p>

        <h2 id="alien-land">Alien Landholding Licence</h2>
        <p>Non-citizens wishing to purchase land or property in Saint Lucia must first obtain an Alien Landholding Licence under the Alien Landholding Regulation Act. This requirement applies to individuals who are not Saint Lucian citizens or CARICOM nationals exercising freedom of movement rights.</p>

        <p>In practice, most legitimate residential property purchases by retirees are approved. Your real estate attorney will manage the Alien Landholding Licence application as part of the property purchase process. <strong>Do not attempt to purchase property without obtaining this licence first</strong> — doing so is a legal violation and can complicate or void the transaction.</p>
        <p>CBI real estate purchases are handled differently — the CBI process includes the necessary government approvals for the qualifying investment property.</p>

            <h4>Apostille and Notarisation</h4>
            <p>Documents from most countries need to be apostilled (officially certified for international use under the Hague Convention) before submission to Saint Lucian authorities. This is done in your home country — check your government's apostille service. Allow time: UK apostilles take 5–15 business days; US varies by state. Start gathering and apostilling documents before you arrive in Saint Lucia.</p>

        <h2 id="lawyers">Finding a Reputable Immigration Lawyer</h2>
        <p>All immigration and CBI applications should be handled or reviewed by a licensed Saint Lucian attorney. The Saint Lucia Bar Association maintains a register of licensed attorneys. For CBI specifically, ensure your agent is on the CIU's official list of authorised agents (published on the CIU website: ciu.govt.lc).</p>

        <p>Key questions to ask a potential immigration attorney:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Are you licensed by the Saint Lucia Bar Association? What is your licence number?</li>
          <li>How many TRP / permanent residence / CBI applications have you handled in the past 3 years?</li>
          <li>What is your total fee estimate for my situation (all-in, including disbursements)?</li>
          <li>What is the realistic timeline for my application?</li>
          <li>What are the most common reasons for rejection in cases like mine?</li>
        </ul>
